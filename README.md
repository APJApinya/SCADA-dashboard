## Overview
The Remote Equipment Monitoring System is a cloud-integrated SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system that enables real-time monitoring of industrial equipment using AWS services.
This project demonstrates the integration of **AWS IoT Core, DynamoDB, API Gateway, Lambda, EventBridge, and SNS** to collect, process, and visualize equipment data.

This project showcases:
- **Cloud-based industrial monitoring** with AWS IoT Core and MQTT.
- **A serverless architecture** using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway.
- **A real-time dashboard** built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
- **Automated alerting** via AWS SNS for abnormal equipment conditions.
